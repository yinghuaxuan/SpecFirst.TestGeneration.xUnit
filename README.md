# SpecFirst.xUnit
SpecFirst.xUnit is a .NET [source generator](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/introducing-c-source-generators/) to automatically generate xUnit tests from [decision tables](https://github.com/yinghuaxuan/spec-first/blob/develop/tests/SpecFirst.Specs/DecisionTable/Validator/DecisionTable.spec.md) authored in markdown.

It is a combined package of the following three individual packages (so that you just need to install one package instead of three if you don't need extensions):
- SpecFirst
- SpecFirst.MarkdownParser
- SpecFirst.TestGenerator.xUnit
